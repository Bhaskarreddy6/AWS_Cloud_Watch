CPU Spike Simulation (cpu_spike.py)

The cpu_spike.py script is designed to simulate high CPU usage on an EC2 instance. This helps in testing AWS CloudWatch alarms by generating artificial load, allowing you to observe how CloudWatch metrics respond and how alarms are triggered.

Purpose

Test CPU utilization alarms in CloudWatch.

Demonstrate automated monitoring and alerting.

Provide a hands-on example for learning AWS monitoring and observability.

Key Points

Generates CPU load using Python loops and optional multithreading.

Duration and intensity of the CPU spike can be configured.

Useful for practicing real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and alerting in AWS environments.
